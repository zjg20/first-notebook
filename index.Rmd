## Survey sheds light on the ‘crisis’ rocking research
#### **More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature's* survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.

# The Survey

In the survey [^2] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

* Better understanding of statistics
* Better mentoring/supervision
* More robust design
* Better teaching
* More within-lab validation
* Incentives for better practice
* Incentives for formal reproduction
* More external-lab validation
* More time for mentoring
* Journals enforcing standards
* More time checking notebooks
